By: M. Aashik Nishath

This repository documents my 15-day Power BI learning sprint where I completed one analytics project each day and selected the top five to rebuild as polished, portfolio-ready dashboards. The goal was simple: practice real data analysis, build strong BI fundamentals, and convert raw datasets into clear decision-making tools.

📌 Final Selected Dashboards (Ranked by Impact)
